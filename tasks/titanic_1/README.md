## Titanic 1 (2 POINTS)

`pandas`

### Task

All functions take as input a titanic dataframe and possibly some parameters specific to this task.

Note that several method calls on dataframes can be combined into one pipeline. In other words, you can write

```
df.func1().func2().funс3()
```

If possible, implement the required functions using pipelines (one if possible). Make line breaks for better code
readability.

### Tasks

Implement the following functions:

1. A function that calculates the average age (Age) of surviving (Survived=1) men (Sex=male) who boarded in
   Southampton (Embarked=S) and bought a ticket for more than 30 pounds (Fare>30). Calculate the value for those
   passengers whose age is known.
2. A function that returns all columns for which there are gaps (nan) in the data.
