## Titanic 3 (2 POINTS)

Implement the following functions:
1. A function that takes a list of ticket numbers (Ticket) and returns the average price (Fare) for tickets from the specified list.
2. A function that takes a list of n columns and returns a list of n values in these columns. You need to return the most popular combination of features for the given columns. For example, for the columns (Survived, Sex) the most popular combination in the dataset will be the values (0, male) - 86 passengers. In other words, there are more non-surviving men in the dataset than surviving men (1, male) (14 passengers), non-surviving women (0, female) (16 passengers), and surviving women (1, female) (40 passengers).
